**AIM**:  
To observe the effect of damping in Forced Vibration of SDOF system due to base excitation

**PROCEDURE**:

1. Set a value of Stiffness and Mass for the system. Set a small value of damping ratio (less than half of 0.707). Notice the natural frequency of the system shown below the graphs. You can set a value of excitation frequency which will be marked in the graph.

2. Click on the right arrow to load the graph of magnification factor and phase angle versus frequency ratio.

3. Click on the left arrow to come back to system display screen. Edit the damping ratio. Set to a value between 0.35 and 0.707.

5. Once again click on the left arrow to come back to system display screen. Edit the damping ratio. Set to a value higher than 0.707.

6. Click on the right arrow to load the graph of magnification factor and phase angle versus frequency ratio and notice the change in Magnification Factor values against frequency ratio.
